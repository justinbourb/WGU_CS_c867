Scripting and Programming Applications
c++ Student Roster Platform  
The program functionality and design are largely set as course requirements.  The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called  classRosterArray Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
